    /*
     * When an external entity connects to the core,
     * it is "registered" - i.e put in a corresponding list -
     * either as a receiver (put in list of receivers) or
     * as a sender (put in list of senders).
     * But before getting it into a list, we check if
     * there is a matching entity in the opposite list.
     * If we found one, the current entity is even not gonna
     * get put in its list, because there is no need of it - 
     * no one will connect to it when it is already in a connection.
     * 
     * To match a corresponding entity in a list, MatchMID() function
     * is used. The MID is retreived from a connecting entity using
     * GetMID() function. MID stands for "Match ID" - you see, the ID,
     * that is used to Match.     
     * A VERY IMPORTANT NOTICE is that if we found a one-sided match,
     * like receiver.MatchMID( sender.GetMID() ) returned true,
     * WE DO NOT ESTABLISH THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THEM UNTIL
     * OPPOSITE MATCH IS PERFORMED - speaking about this example,
     * it would be sender.MatchMID( receiver.GetMID ) - this must return true
     * or otherwise we skip the pair (and maybe log this event
     * in a base of interesting events)
     * 
     * CONFIG FILE:
     * Legend:
     * [optinal] - this can be omitted
     * this/that/those/.. - only one must present
     * <template> - this must be replaced with the
     * string that corresponds the word in those
     * angle brackets
     * ... - "and so on" - this 
     *
     * Notes:
     * All the paths, given in the file, that are not full,
     * are evaluated starting with the curent directory.
     * But the very current directory may be specified
     * differently. This is given in the first line of the
     * config file.
     * 
     * File Format:
     * first line - where the current directory is located: configfile/executable/<directory>
     * if it is "configfile", then current directory is set to the location
     * of the config file, same with "executable" - where the executable is located.
     * If none on those met, we try to set it to the given string,
     * assuming it specifies some directory. If we don't succeed,
     * just return an error PATH_NOT_FOUND
     * Current directory is needed to calculate each of the next
     * paths, if they are not full.
     * Next strings just locate the .dll files used as interfaces:
     * [<.dll path>]
     * [<.dll path>]
     * ...
     * 
     * CODE REVIEW POSSIBLE:
     * When we pass IDs or delegates to the
     * connected entities, we use that strange
     * mechanism: Pass{ entity.Accept( field ) },
     * just because we don't want Core to know
     * anything about those fields. But it looks
     * pretty awkward.
